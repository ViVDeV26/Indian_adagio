<span><p style="margin: 60px; font-size: 20px;">This thesis project consists of the development of a contributory web application which is an
    online classical music player. This music player is primarily dedicated for classical music which
    takes you back to the golden era of Indian cinema. This app contains playlist of Indian classical
    song classified on the basis of artist name. This app is designed for people living in their 50s-60s
    to make them feel like they are living in their childhood again. It gives you a totally different
    experience as you won’t be knowing that which song will play next. This web application will
    consume least data possible as it won’t be showing you any ads or any extra stuffs which requires
    internet and the user will be able to listen music even in slow network connection.
